The trend line on the monthly gross sales bar graph shows the overall sales trend throughout the year. Let me explain what it's telling you:

What the Trend Line Shows:
Direction of Sales Over Time:

Upward slope: Sales are increasing over the months
Downward slope: Sales are decreasing over the months
Flat/horizontal: Sales are relatively stable
How It's Calculated:

Uses linear regression (a statistical method) to find the best-fit straight line through all the monthly sales data points
The line represents the average trend, smoothing out month-to-month fluctuations
What You Can Learn:

Business growth/decline: See if your sales are improving or declining over the year
Seasonality patterns: Compare actual monthly bars to the trend line to see which months perform above or below the average trend
Performance variance: Months where bars are far above the trend line are your peak months; bars below indicate slower periods
Example Interpretations:
If the trend line goes up from left to right: Your business is growing throughout the year
If the trend line goes down from left to right: You need to investigate why sales are declining
If bars in certain months are much higher than the trend: Those are your peak seasons
If bars are below the trend line: Those months underperformed compared to your overall trajectory
The red dashed line makes it easy to spot these patterns at a glance, rather than just looking at individual monthly bars!
